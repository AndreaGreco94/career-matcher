Prompt for Building a Node.js Web App with ChatGPT: ‚ÄúTechnical Career Matcher‚Äù

Develop a full-stack web application using Node.js (Express) that takes as input a set of questions and answers provided by a student about their interests and preferences. The backend will process these inputs and call ChatGPT (OpenAI API) to generate a suggestion for the most appropriate technical career path, including a detailed explanation for the recommendation.
üîß Backend Functionality (Node.js)

    Build a secure RESTful API that accepts a payload containing structured responses to a variety of question types:

        Single choice (e.g., radio buttons)

        Multiple choice (e.g., checkboxes)

        Open-ended responses (e.g., free text inputs)

    Payload formatting: transform user responses into a well-structured prompt suitable for AI processing.

    OpenAI API integration (chat/completions endpoint) to fetch:

        The suggested technical role (e.g., "Data Analyst", "Frontend Developer", "Machine Learning Engineer")

        A detailed rationale tailored to the student‚Äôs answers.

    Input validation and sanitization (to prevent XSS, SQL/NoSQL injection, etc.)

    Error handling for malformed requests, OpenAI API failures, or timeouts.

    Security best practices:

        Rate limiting

        Input validation via schema (Joi or Zod)

        HTTP header protection (helmet)

        CORS configuration

        Optional: JWT-based auth or API key protection
